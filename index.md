Welcome to my GitHub hosted static Website.

I have another [Website](https://www.geoffreyenglish.wordpress.com) which will eventually be migrated over to this one.

I'm sure Jekyll and other environments have reasonably nice ways of doing this, but I wouldn't learn much doing it that
way would I?

The plan is to do as much of this, as manually as is practicable, in an effort to learn as much of the nuts and bolts as
possible.

In the meantime here's my [contact](https://drylabrebel.github.io/blog/contact.md) information, if for some strange reason you might like to get in touch with me.
