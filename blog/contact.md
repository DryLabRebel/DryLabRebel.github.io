I am a Data Scientist at the Australian Tax Office developing modelling and automation software for a team running econometrics models including difference in differences, regression discontinuity and XGBoost.

I specialize in python development, automation, business strategy and devOps.

I completed my PhD in statistical genetics at QIMR Berghofer in 2021.

My PhD project focussed on advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, using big data and high performance compute clusters to better understand the shared genetic relationship between ADHD presentations and to predict biological correlates using some of the worlds largest available genetic datasets.
