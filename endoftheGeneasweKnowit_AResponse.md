I'll be the judge of that.

> a crude statistical model of them, involving dozens of unlikely assumptions

First of all, if anyone is going to stir things up in statistical genetics, it's going to be me,

and 'crude statistical models' sounds like batshit crazy conspiracy rhetoric. Way to appeal to the mystery of complicated statistics to plant the seed of doubt in your readers.

> Extravagant promises were made that genes would soon be found that control human intelligence, social behavior, and complex diseases

- Noone made any promises about the timeline of this important, highly complex field of science.  
- A field which has slowly got the cogs turning over the last 150 years is not being criticized for not 'making good' on its promises to deliver a comprehensive understanding of human genetics within 20 years of sequencing the human genome! A endeavour which itself took nearly ten years and came at, as the article rightly states, 'enormous cost'.  

- The author is making broad biochemical simplifications, making rudimentary statements about biochemical interactions which are not at all new to any practising geneticist.  
- He seems to be implying that modern genetics has been working under the pretense that 'genes' are in control of all of this behaviour. No geneticist I know of believes this. this seems ignorant at best. At worst it looks like a deliberately disingenuous smear campaign, and publicity grab.

- the whole feel of the article reads like a conspiracy theory hit piece. Making vague references to 'scientists' (which scientists?) and appealing to the ignorance of complex genetic and statistical models.  

- This statement seems to be based on the grostest misunderstanding of modern genetics. Apparently the author has not even a graduate understanding of genetic signalling, and the gene switching pathways, epigenetic processes which guide cell division, etc.

- No one is saying that DNA has a 'mind of its own', the entire process of genetics functions as highly complex interactions between polymerazes, spliceosomes, and many more proteins and complexes, working with signalling molecules, to orchestrate which genes will be expressed (cell specific expression) and the rate of expression (enrichment).

- The primary impetus for this article seems heavily dependent on the ignorance of its target audience on the subject matter. The author is relying in the reader to have less than even a rudimentary understanding of cell biology, and the role of gene expression in biochemical processes.

Another thing is, he’s making references to biochemistry and making it sound as if our biochemistry ’thinks for itself’, which is ridiculous. or that things occur that have nothing to do with our DNA that’s kind of true. But it’s not special. Most of what goes on in our bodies at the biological level is overseen and controlled by the proteins in our body, and other processes which all involve proteins. Changes in our DNA affects the behaviour of those proteins. Of course changes in our environment will too. That doesn’t mean the whole system has any ’thinking’ capacity beyond DNA.

> As Jeremy J. Berg and colleagues warned this December in the online journal Biorxiv,

BioRxiv is *not* an 'online journal' (not in the sense the author is implying). BioRxve is a popualar platform for researchers in the biological sciences to submit their research manuscripts for public viewing and peer review *before that research is published*. Articles on BioRxve are still under review, and therefore still subject to changes (which is most often the case).

> Another wrench in the works has been the discovery that a gene product typically undergoes rearrangements before being put to use. It means that different proteins, with potentially widely different functions, can be produced from the same gene: not one for one, as the central dogma has told us. 

This is incorrect. 1st year biology undergraduates learn that a segment of transcribed RNA is made up of 'introns' and 'exons'. Introns are a section of the RNA that is removed by spliceosomes and forms part of the 'non-coding' region of the genome (with respect to a given gene at least). It is certainly true that different regions of the genome can be 'cut-and-pasted' so to speak, and particular stretches of DNA can ultimately be used to provide the coding seuqence for multiple proteins. But the same 'gene' as it is understood, does not code for different proteins. Rather, a specific sequence of DNA may be used to code for more than one 'gene' which in turn provides the sequence to produce more than one protein. The author has over-simplified the central dogma in this case.

And to reiterate again, this is genetics 101. Not at all news to anyone with a biology degree.

Overall, this whole article reads like a tabloid hit piece that's about 20 years out of date.
